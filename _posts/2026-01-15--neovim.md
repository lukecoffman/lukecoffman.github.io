When it comes to locally editing LaTeX documents, writing code, working on this website, etc. the editor that I use is Neovim (btw).


## 


- Have a github repo with my Neovim config
- Explain how to install Neovim and configure it
- Basics of moving around and quiting the editor
- Setting up Zathura and Zotero integration
