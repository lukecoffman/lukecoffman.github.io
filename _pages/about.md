My name is Luke, I'm a G1 PhD Student at [Harvard](https://quantum.harvard.edu/) in the Quantum Science and Engineering (QSE) program and [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) working with [Dr. Jordan Cotler](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/cotler) and [Dr. Anurag Anshu](https://anuraganshu.seas.harvard.edu/) in the realm of quantum learning theory and mathematical physics.

I recieved my BA in Physics and Mathematics from the [University of Colorado, Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/physics/) where I worked with [Dr. Graeme Smith](https://gsbsmith.ca/) and [Dr. Xun Gao](https://www.colorado.edu/physics/xun-gao). During my BA, I was named a [Goldwater Scholar](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/) and [Astronaut Scholar](https://www.astronautscholarship.org/).

I've spent time at Los Alamos, ORNL, IQC, and other places over the years (see my CV for more details). I am a curator for the QLT Zoo, I run a YouTube channel called [Iota Irrep](https://www.youtube.com/@IotaIrrep) where I do science and math explainers on different topics I'm interested in, and I also am developing a personal AI research assistant named Neumann. For fun I play curling and enjoy rock climbing, as well as, play the piano and guitar.

## Research Interests

My research aims to understand how we can learn quantum systems, predict their behavior, and quantify resources that enable a quantum advantage. I use quantum information theory, learning theory, representation theory, and geometry to explore:
- When is it easy or hard to learn a set of properties about a quantum system? 
- When can we simulate or predict their behavior efficiently? 
- What resources can improve or hinder our ability to complete these tasks?

My ultimate goal is to leverage the gap between quantum and classical physics to lay the theoretical foundations for quantum enhanced technology.
