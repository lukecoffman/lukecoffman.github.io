## What is Neumann?
Neumann is an AI research tool that I have been developing in my free time. At its core, its a specalized local LLM that allows researchers to "talk" to their research projects and notes while maintaining privacy. First and foremost, this is a tool which I am developing for myself and my particular use cases. Second, this is an excuse to learn some basic techniques in ML. For the time being, everything is public and open source so that if people want to deploy a version of this for themselves they are more than welcome. But remember this is a passion project.
