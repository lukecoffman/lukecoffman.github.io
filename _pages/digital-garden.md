## What is a Digital Garden?
A digital garden is a collection of notes, thoughts, or ideas grown throughout the course of learning, teaching, or research. Think of this as a public log or Zettelkasten of topics that I've explored / am currently exploring and as a living document. My personal hopes are to make the research process more public, provide explinations of ideas that maybe aren't explicitly spelled out in the literature, as well as, to provide a resource for students learning new topics as I am learning them for the first time. In essence, a digital footprint for myself which other students could follow the steps of.

The vast majority of these notes are pulled from my personal [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/) (see **this blog post for an outline of my research work flow**).
