## What is Iota Irrep?
[Iota Irrep](https://www.youtube.com/@IotaIrrep) is a YouTube channel that I run exploring different topics in science, largely focusing on quantum physics and mathematics. The name is a combination of a couple of nerdy references in mathematics. An "irrep" is a small (an "iota") fundamental building block of symmetry in the field of **representation theory** (link). The point is to break things down into their fundamental components and extract an "iota" of truth. The symbol for iota, \\(\iota\\), is also a common choice for the inclusion map in mathematics, \\(\iota:X\hookrightarrow Y\\), representing that this endevor and science as a whole should be open to all.
