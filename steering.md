This is just a simple document for me to outline features that I am working on / considering.

1. Obsidian styled callouts
2. Relative linking of md files
    - Ability to link to a specific callout and only preview that callout
3. Internal link previewing
    - Preview stacking
4. Obsidian integration
    - Add dg-publish: to YAML in Obsidian
    - Write python script to search through vault and find pages with this property
    - Format the pages correctly, then integrate into website
    - Find a method for fetching zotero citations and embedding them nicely
    - Also find a way to graph images and other embeddings properly
5. Interactive website graph side bar
6. Table of contents sidebar with tabs for sorting through different callouts
7. Neumann integation
8. Create Github page for Neovim config
9. Create Github page for Obsidian config
10. Create Github page for template website
